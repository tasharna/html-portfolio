<h1>Tasharna's Favourite Movies </h1>
<h2>Here are 3 movies to consider watching this year. </h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Book of Clarence</h3>
<p>This movie takes on a different, yest also comedic approach to the story of Clarence and Jesus Christ. Produced by Jay Z himself, this movie includes some amazing black actors and actresses from around the world.</p>
<h3>Barbie</h3>
<p>This one here is a strong 10/10. Eventhough this movie is based around the infamous doll from our childhood, it also picks up on issues young women could be struggling with in today's society.</p>
<h3>Talk to Me</h3>
<p>Now if you're into horror movies and love a good jumpscare, then this is something I would highly consider watching.</p>
