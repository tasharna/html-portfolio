  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>I was a student Photographer with 3 years' experience; however, I am now looking for part time employment while carrying out my Carer duties and responsibilities. Recently working as a receptionist, I have gained an excellent reputation amongst colleagues for customer service and attention to detail. As a true team player, I am willing to undertake tasks across the company that fall outside of my role's main remit. Having an organised personality and a common-sense approach to problem solving, I work well under pressure and a smile never leaves my face. Furthermore, I am open to learning new skills to fulfil the responsibilities. </p>
